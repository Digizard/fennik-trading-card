Fennik Trading Card
===================

The goal of this project was to create an "Animal Trading Card" for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. As long as the main features of the design prototype were followed, there is freedom to customize the card further.

How to Use
----------

Open up `card.html` in your favorite browser. You can view the card there.

By hovering your cursor over the card, it will flip to reveal a back.
